# HelperBot 2.0
I remade HelperBot basically entirely, it's actually useful now. I switched from Python to Node because *speed*, I have a few things setup but not a whole ton yet, here's a list of what I still am planning to add:

- [X] Give the colour palette a preview image
- [ ] Put everything into embeds because embeds are sex
- [ ] Add help command
- [ ] Give an explanation to every command
- [ ] Statistics (I don't even know for what but if there's something more sex than embeds it's statistics)
- [ ] Add a challenge log, backlog it with a database and let it release every so often
- [ ] Make it look sexier
- [X] Reminders
- [ ] Google Calendar implementation
- [ ] Wishlist (per person so you could do one of those secret santa things)
- [ ] Generate inspirational quotes
- [ ] Along with ^ I want to put the quotes in front of a really inspirational landscapey view, and let people implement their own quote
- [ ] Graphical calculator
- [X] LMGTFY command

I will make this work with 1 guild per bot because laziness, so if you want to use it (no idea why anybody would want to), you have to setup your own environment
